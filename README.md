SANDWICH

I love sandwich.
 Because it has mayonnaise and stretchy cheese and other vegetables in it.
 I rarely eat chicken sandwiches, but I eat vegetables sandwiches the most.
My mother makes delicious sandwiches at home. She is a good chef..
And she makes dosa sandwich also, which is very tasty.. :)
